# MP3 Player - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this project, I built a basic MP3 Player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal is to explore essential string and array methods by implementing core music player features such as audio playback control, playlist management, and dynamic interface updates.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Interactive Media Application
- **Purpose**: Practice string and array methods while building a fully functional MP3 player.
- **Skills Learned**: JavaScript string & array methods, audio API usage, UI manipulation

## Features
- ▶️ **Play & Pause**: Users can control playback with smooth functionality.
- ⏭️ **Next & Previous**: Navigate through the playlist using array methods.
- 🔀 **Shuffle Mode**: Randomly plays songs using logic based on array shuffling.
- 🎵 **Dynamic UI Updates**: Song title, artist, and visual indicators update in real time.
- 📂 **Playlist Handling**: Playlist is stored as an array and manipulated dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Markup for audio player layout and controls
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean, responsive music interface
- **JavaScript**: Audio control, playlist logic, dynamic DOM manipulation

## Installation
To try the MP3 player:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure your browser supports the HTML5 `<audio>` element.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
